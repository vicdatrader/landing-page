# landing-page

My first entire website using my flexbox skills learned from TOP

I started this project on 05/18/2022 and completed on 05/26/2022. I am grateful to have progressed this far in TOP. So far, I have learned how to use HTML, CSS, and intuitively use flexbox to create cool, modern, and responsive webpages. This project, landing page, tested the knowledge of everything I have learned so far. Next step is to tackle JavaScript! So Excited!
